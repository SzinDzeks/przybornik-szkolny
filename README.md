# przybornik-szkolny
This is a second version of school logbook created for my private use back when my school had only physical copies of grades. Helped me improve my grades at the end of the year.

I won't accept any pull requests. This code is kept here because of my nostalgy and as a symbol of the progress I made over the years.


PS. It's made in C#, because I wanted to make Unity games and this was (and still is) the language to go.
    ...
    I never actually got around to learn Unity :)
